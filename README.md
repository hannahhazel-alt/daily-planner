## Description

Welcome to my daily planner! You can use this to log in your appointments for the day, I have used javascript for the logic and don't worry about the text disappearing, just hit that save icon on the side and it will save to the local storage.

I made this app to challenge myself with thrid-party APIs and to enhance my knowledge about JavaScript and Jquery. This helps me brigde the gap in my knowlegde and gets me one step closer to becoming a proffessional develpoer. Throughout the making of this I found out the importance of using up-to-date libraires and why we use them. I learnt that not everything has to be written in JavaScript and to really utilise my HTML.

If you have time use this app for the day! Later on when I get more confortable with JavaScript, I want to change the aesthetic to refelct my personality more with colour changes and designs. However, my main problem was getting to create this, almost from scratch in the the first place. So, again, if you have some time to play around with this please do!

## Installation

There is a link to the deployed URL for this app at the top of the page. Follow that link and simply type into the boxes, anything grey is in the past, anything red is the hour happening right now and anything green is in the future. Please use the green boxes once the app is open and hit that save icon to keep any text in the local storage. Don't worry, you can clear this from your local storage at any time or simply edit out the text, hit that save button again and it will be clear again. This app changes each day so when you reload the page the next day the date should reflect the same day.

## Usage

To keep track of the you day, whether it be meetings, appointments or tasks at work.
